With my busy schedule it has always been procrastinating, and now alhamdulillah I'm so grateful! Shahani is a lovely soul who takes all the trouble to teach right. The learning method and the recalling sessions are very important for me and you do it so beautifully. Especially with my lectures happening haphazardly, you are so kind to be flexible with my times! And I really appreciate that! Jazakallah for everything and may Allah bless you immensely.`,

And Jazakallah for pushing so hard to get the best for me. The best part of you is, although you have just started, whenever you realise a particular way of learning is difficult for the student, you try many ways and find an easier way for us. I really like that adopting nature, it makes our life also very easy. You have a long long long way to go girl, In Sha Allah! May Allah bless you immensely. Ameen. Take good care. Keep in touch.`,

I am very satisfied with your method of teaching and the fact that you give written notes for the parent to revise at home along with the child. Initially we had story time and that was very interesting too. JazakAllah!`,

Her usthad had told that she has done very well and also that if he was to give marks for beauty, she would have gotten full marks for that too. Alhamdulillah we are very happy.

Every class means so much to me, it's not just about learning what's in the Qur'an only, but also about understanding how it connects to real life and the things we go through every day. We only have two classes a week, but I'm always counting the days till the next one because I enjoy them so much, Alhamdulillah. You explain everything in such a clear way and make it so easy to relate to. Every class leaves me feeling grateful and inspired, and I really see it as a blessing in my life. Thanks again miss.`,
